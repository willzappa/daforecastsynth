Authors: Zappa, W., Walther, T. & van den Broek, M (2020). Synthesising forecasts of load and variable renewable generation 
for day-ahead, intraday, and balancing market modelling. Submitted to Applied Energy.

Instructions:

The .ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing an example implementation of the method for onshore wind. The .xlsx file contains an example dataset based on historical French onshore wind real-time and day-ahead forecasts. Simply download the files, adjust the folder and file paths in the Jupyter notebooks to point to the .xlsx file and desired output directory, and run the script.
